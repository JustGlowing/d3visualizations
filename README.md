D3js Visualizations
============

This repository contains some experiments I made with the d3js.

At the moment this repo contains:

* A scatterplot made with data from a JSON document and a fancy tooltip feature.
* A network visualization with arrows, pand and zoom. The data is read from a JSON document.
